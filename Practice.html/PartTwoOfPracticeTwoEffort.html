        <p>Hatsune Miku as a famous vocaloid that was voiced by Sagi Fujita. Miku was made ethically and Sagi was paid for her works. Miku does have a fandom that is more based on her character than her music. She operated by people using noises like "Ihhh" in British to spell out words.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first meme is from an older media that was adapted for Miku cuz why not.</li>
          <li>The second is from a gif about a character from Bleach that was once again associated to Miku cuz WHY NOT!</li>
          <li>The third is based off of the scene in Inside Out 2 where anxiety comes in but is unwelcome, this represents Miku and Teto's "Rivalry" in the vocaloid fandom.</li>
        </ul>
